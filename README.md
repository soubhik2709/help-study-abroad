# Help Study Abroad Dashboard

A modern admin dashboard built with Next.js, TypeScript, Zustand, and Material UI (MUI).

The project focuses on scalable frontend architecture, dashboard optimization, protected routing, API handling, state management, caching, and performance-focused React patterns.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Login Credentials

```text
username: admin
password: 1234
```

---

## API Architecture

The project uses Next.js API proxy routes to fetch external data safely and avoid browser CORS restrictions during frontend development.

Frontend requests are routed through:

```text
/api/proxy/*
```

before communicating with external APIs such as DummyJSON.

This architecture also makes future backend integration easier and keeps API handling centralized.

---

## Performance Optimizations

- Zustand selector optimization using `useShallow`
- Component memoization using `React.memo`
- Request caching for paginated/search data
- Duplicate API request prevention
- Optimized rerender handling

---

## Future Improvements

- Real backend integration
- Database support
- JWT / NextAuth authentication
- Server-side pagination
- Role-based access control
- Dashboard analytics
- Deployment on Vercel
